# js-cart

This code is intended for instructional purposes only. No claims of fitness for actual online shopping are expressed or implied. (What I'm saying here is that this code does a pretty good job at replicating the front-end experience of an online shopping site. However, you'd be nuts to use this unless in conjunction with some robust server-side authentication scripts.)
